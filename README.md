## Decorator
    decorator is function that takes another function
    as a argument and extend the behavior of latter function with explicitly modifying it.


## oops 
    1.in python all are object 
    2. There four ways to write code
        imperative
        functional
        procedural
        object
    3. commonly we use procedure and object oriented program

## Difference in procedure & Object

    ## Procedure
        1. It divided into functions , each function dedicated to specific task, each 
            executed sequenial order
        2. It's used only smaller task. If task bigger code also big , DEBUGGING take longer
        3. Sequrity is not
        4. Access modifier's not present
        5. Top-Down approach  -> This one follows big problems are 
            divided to small chunk of code then small problems Debugged and integrated 

    ## Object
        1. It divided to objects 
        2. It's used to bigger tasks
        3. Data Sequirty is available (Encapsulation)
        4. Access modifiers are avaliable , 
            like  .. private, public, prodected those where used in inheritence
        5. Bottom-up approach -> First solve the small problems in fundametal level 
            then integrate with complete solution

## Class

    Class is an object constructor or blueprint from which object created
    Class are the user defined blue prints that used to create object
    Memory not allocated While class is created

## Object
    Object is instance of class
    Object is the real world entity of class
    When objected created for class, then it will create memory 

    Process of creating Object is called *instantiation*
    
    1. State
            attributes of object, different states for each obj
    2. behaviour
            methods of object , Both diff and similarity of functionality in each object
    3. identity
            Each  object had the own name(unique)
